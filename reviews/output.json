The moment you arrive, you can feel the charm and energy surrounding this world-famous landmark. The views from the different levels are breathtaking\u2014whether you\u2019re looking over the Seine, the historic streets of Paris, or the skyline stretching out in every direction, it\u2019s unforgettable.  The tower itself is impressive both during the day and at night. By day, you can admire the detailed ironwork and the beauty of the city in natural light. By night, when the Eiffel Tower sparkles with thousands of lights, it feels like stepping into a dream. The elevator ride to the top is smooth and exciting, and once there, the panoramic view is worth every second.  It\u2019s more than just a monument\u2014it\u2019s an experience full of history, romance, and wonder. I highly recommend visiting both in daylight and after dark to capture its full magic.",
