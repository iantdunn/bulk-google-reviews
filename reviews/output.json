Took me 3 tries to actually score tickets, but it worked out.  Be aware that on extremely hot days like over 95deg F, they will close the summit (you'll get a refund if you booked ahead).  We went on the day after the heat wave, so we were able to ascend.  Pro tip:  Don't dally when you change elevators on the 2nd floor to go to the summit.  Go directly to the summit elevator line, you can visit the 2nd floor on your way back down.  The longer you wait, the longer the summit elevator line will be, and that is a miserable line if you get caught.  Our tickets were for 12:30pm entry, and we were at the summit before 1pm.",
